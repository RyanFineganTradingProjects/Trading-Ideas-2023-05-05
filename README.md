# Trading Idea 2023/05/05
I created two quick trade ideas for a small personal project. I wound up leaving out the Bloomberg BQuant code because even though it was created on my own time outside of work hours, the Bloomberg account was through my company and I wasn't sure if there were any ethical issues. I can reproduce and share if anyone is interested.

Given the conditional probabilities provided by the Frank Copula of the GLD-XLV pair, the systematic strategy would have gotten you out at $189.02 (a gain of 83 bps before accounting for slippage and transaction costs).

However, given the current macro environment, I believe a long in GLD US Equity is still a smart position.

Please see the pptx for a validation backtest applied to this current year (shows conditional probabilities with prices.
