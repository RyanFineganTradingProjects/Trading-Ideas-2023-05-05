# Trading Idea 2023/05/05
I created two quick trade ideas for a small personal project. I wound up leaving out the Bloomberg BQuant code.

# Trading Idea Update: As of 2023/05/22:
# GLD US Equity Long

Given the conditional probabilities provided by the Frank Copula of the GLD-XLV pair, the systematic strategy would have gotten you out at $189.02 (a gain of 83 bps before accounting for slippage and transaction costs).

However, given the current macro environment, I believe a long in GLD US Equity is still a smart position.

Please see the pptx for a validation backtest applied to this current year (shows conditional probabilities with prices.

# HELE US Equity Short
Helen of Troy's stock closed at $97.15 as of May 19th. This was and still is a long term trade given their accounting gimmicks and rollup strategy. Rollups won't work in a high rate environment and their organic growth is quite poor given their brands have little to no synergies from previous acquisitions.
